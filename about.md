## Here's a bit about me
I studied physics in college, where I learned a good bit of problem solving. The 
defining feature of my education was the couple of seasons of FSAE, where I helped 
design, fabricate, and test racecars. I'm still very thankful for the friends I made
while there and the lessons I learned. 

My internship experience covers process improvement in manufacturing, non-profit 
logistics and fin-tech. I'm working as a Data Engineer at a great ad tech firm atm.

I don't study quite as much anymore but I do learn plenty - mostly at work but some
on my own time. I like to write about what I'm learning, so I keep notes [blog](/blog)
for my future self and anyone that might benefit. 

## Here are some things I know how to do,
* Python
* SQL
* AWS
* GCP
