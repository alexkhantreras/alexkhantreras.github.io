Here's where I stand atm. I'm holding a degree in physics, have a few years of
work experience under my belt that extends from manufacturing to the non-profit
space, and an ambition to continue forging a career in data analytics and process
improvement.

If I'm not enjoying myself I'm improving myself, so I'm always game for an
adventure or for learning a new skill. Currently, that's a lot of stats review
and expanding on the machine learning work I did during my final year of school.

I also like to write about what I'm learning, so check the [blog](/blog). If you
have any questions feel free to shoot me a message.

## Here are some things I know how to do:
	* Python
	* NumPy
	* Pandas
	* SQL
	* Tableau
	* Experiment and process design
	* Statistical analysis
	* Git

## And here are a few questions I've tried to answer:
	* Is the Tarrant Area Food Bank making a dent in hunger in North Texas?
	* How is reddit feeling about ____?
	* Will you enjoy ____ based on Yelp! reviews and your current mood?
