## Chapter 2: Are You Smarter Than A Television Pundit?
Hardly anyone foresaw the fall of the Berlin Wall. Few predicted the collapse of the USSR a few years later despite it being the most important geo-political event since WWII and despite the massive momentum with which such an event would arrive. Dr. Tetlock of UC Berkley wondered why?

Tetlock followed political commentary on television and found that pundits were no better than a fair coin at determining whether or not an event would come to pass. Of 733 predictions made by television pundits  Tetlock found

- 39% of True events predicted correctly
- 37% of False events predicted correctly
- 7% of Mostly True claims made correctly
- 4% of Mostly False claims made correctly
- 13% of Partly True/False claims made correctly

Of course, a better description of the sample set would have been Television Personalities’ Opinions, so Tetlock looked at legitimate experts next. Political scientists and analyst in varying fields were surveyed and their past work examined in light of other major occurrences of the 80s and 90s. In aggregate, the experts were hardly better.

- A whopping 15% of events that experts said were impossibilities occurred.
- An even larger 25% of events experts said were sure things did not happen.

Individually though, a few fared significantly better. Again, Tetlcok wondered why?

**The Right Attitude for Making Better Predictions**

Today, we call it the growth mindset, but at release of Tetlock’s best selling book it was framed as a difference between two kinds of thinkers - hedgehogs, who know one big thing, and foxes, who know many little things. Political pundits and experts who were very willing to give their opinion were hedgehogs and were, in aggregate and individually, worse predictors. Foxes were scarce in political punditry and were more reluctant to take decisive stands on many issues. They turned out to predict events accurately much more often.

The labels aren’t exclusive to political experts. Folks of all walks process new information differently. Hedgehogs were likely to stick to a plan and fit new data where it improved their pre-determined scheme. Foxes were more fluid and readily adjusted both their predictions and their world views based on vetted analysis. The phenomenon manifested in interesting ways. For instance, hedgehogs tended to worsen in predictive ability with more experience, information, and education. It seemed they contorted the new data to support the stories that kept their universe neat and tidy and strayed further from the truth as a result. Foxes slowly but steadily improved their predictive ability with more experience and knowledge, refining their own views in an objective manner.

Interesting as well, is the fact that foxes tended to rate themselves as worse predictors than hedgehogs, who were much more sure of their knowledge and ability.

**Why Political Predictions Tend to Fail**

The case of the /National Journal/ Political Insiders’ Poll brings to the surface how most people behave like hedgehogs. The poll surveys hundreds of political pundits, commentators, pollsters, consultants, and other insiders of all political persuasions. Ahead of the 2010 midterms they were asked to predict the overall number of seats that Democrats and Republicans would lose or gain. People on both sides of the aisle were in relative agreement. When asked about specific races however, Democrats were much more confident in predicting favorable outcomes for Democratic candidates while Republicans did the same for Republican candidates. The respondents were now focused on the little bits of information they had about those races - the headline they read that morning, the campaign slogan’s viability study results, gossip they heard regarding the campaign trail, little things that they used to keep their universe tidy. They placed unrealistic levels of importance on their knowledge not only because of their politics but because of their want to believe that they had the inside scoop. The results of those specific races were again center of the two extremes.


**A Fox-Like Approach to Forecasting**

FiveThirtyEight has been more accurate in predicting political events in part because of three principles that guide its analysis.

1. Thinking Probabilistically
Good predictions usually articulate a range of possibilities and include the likelihoods of each. The probabilistic approach is the honest way of expressing uncertainty that is always present.

2. Iterating Forecasts
In all domains it is also necessary to accept the volatility of information. Polls, even the more accurate aggregate polls, change. The models built on top of these must change to reflect this. This is often incorrectly and dangerously characterized as being indecisive but the real lack of courage is in failing to update analysis when new information presents itself.

3. Consensus
In the 24 hour news cycle pundits have an interest in keeping the conversation exciting. It benefits them to focus on the one outlier study or poll that shows contradicting predictions to the consensus. FiverThirtyEight makes use of aggregate polls because they’re usually 15-20% more accurate than individual polls. This aggregation is also what foxes do in their heads, looking for various little ideas that better inform a prediction.

**The Fall of the USSR**

The pieces were there and the prediction was not so bold, but few solved the puzzle because few were willing to come to center. Conservatives in general were correct about the dire state of the Soviet economy. GDP was declining by 5% annually and inflation was into double digits. The Soviet Block states received more in aid from Moscow than they contributed so most Russians were willing to cut them loose.
Liberals in general were more willing to see Gorbachev's notions glasnost as legitimate, not as propaganda. The coup attempt by hardliners had been repulsed and reform was in the hearts of the people as well as in the minds of leadership. 

But alas, there was more bickering between the two sides than effective exchange of knowledge and ideas. In the end the downfall of the USSR was claimed to have been inevitable, though few made that claim prior to 1991.
