description: What I thought of An American Marriage, by Tayari Jones

---

> **“A marriage is more than your heart, it's your life. And we are not
  sharing ours.”**

That quote is the premise of Jones' book. After a bout with injustice, Roy
and Celestial are separated when he's wrongly imprisoned. The lead up to that
event is gripping, but the main event of the story is how the two deal with
the separation. 

Usually when finishing a good book, there's a sense of
longing for the world you just experienced. But in this case, you will be
relieved to be done. There's real stress to experience in those pages. There is
the unfairness of the wrongful imprisonment, which weighs heavy on the
characters and on the reader, but there are also very tense scenes when Roy,
Celestial, and the third leg of their triangle reunite. It's also difficult to
see how they can end up in a good place. 

Nevertheless, I'm glad for the read. Jones' writing is beautiful and it rings
true. Roy and Celeste are from Louisiana and Georgia, and we're privy to
their world, but the feelings the characters experience are valid regardless
of where you call home.

> land.”

I'll warn a lot happens in the 5ish years over which the story takes place, but
there is very little action. Most of the story takes place in a handful of
locations, involves very few characters, and relies heavily on dialogue and
introspection to communicate. But that's part of the greatness. Jones worries
very little about superficial decor and focuses on the beauty of the characters
and the settings. There's no one to love or to cheer for without question.
There's no one to hate or to root against. The characters are strongly written
and they drive the story forward in a very realistic way. Yet, you're on the
edge of your favorite seat during several pieces of the book. 

My only complaint is that the ending is great. What will happen between Roy
and Celestial once the reader leaves is obvious. The epilogue makes it explicit.
I think that it's very unnecessary. It's a pair of training wheels.

Last, I'll state that I'll remember this book for one other reason. I usually
don't care to look into the author's background and very rarely even learn who
they are. In light of the BLM Movement and the George Floyd protest I figured I
ought to start. Tayari Jones will be the first African American author I'll
remember reading, and might be the first African American author I've read.
Stepping into new territory doesn't mean only into new topics, but also into new
perspectives. I've done a poor job reading Black authors, authors from my birth-
country of Mexico, or authors outside of the very narrow group that writes about
math, data, or economics (my usual reads). There are whole other worlds right in
front of me that I've been missing.
