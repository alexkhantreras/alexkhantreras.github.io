## Chapter 3: All I Care About Are Ws and Ls

Professional baseball is a microcosm of the data revolution that our economies are working and struggling through now. Before ‘data driven’ was a common phrase, Major League teams were using the immense stores of numbers to answer the primary question in professional sports - how to turn money into wins, and those wins into more money.

In the MLB, new players are signed to initial 6-year contracts, and can only negotiate as free agents after this term. So teams have to answer at least one of two questions,

1. Will this rookie be worth the 6 year contract figure?
2. Is this 6 year veteran past his prime and now worth less?

Questions of prediction have lately been answered by the input of huge amounts of information into mechanisms that spit out a forecast . The question was a source of significant tension in the MLB but the sport seems to have adopted a balanced approach.

## Scouts vs StatHeads

Baseball has always been data rich, but a schism occurred when traditional scouting was forced to the margins by the statistical analysis of high school, college, and minor league players as a means to identify talent. Very suddenly, scouting professionals that had spent decades with a team in one capacity or another found themselves replaced by computers and mathematicians.

Naturally and rightfully resentful, the scouts argued that these models couldn’t capture everything required to identify promising talent, that former players, coaches, or someone with intimate knowledge of the game would always be necessary.

PECOTA is Nate Silver’s baseball analytics tool. Purchased by a larger firm soon after development, the system quickly gained a reputation for accurate prediction of future stars, duds, record and league outcomes. It worked partly by comparing players to each other and calculating a similarity score. Based on dozens of metrics like height and swing speed, the system would typecast prospective rookies into categories. When it was possible to state quantifiably how similar a player was to a Hall-of-Famer it became much easier to make a drafting decision. The system made many great calls that eluded scouts.

On the other hand, the former players and coaches serving as scouts had access to the same player stats as the computers did, though they could not crunch the numbers as well, and an additional intuitive sense for talent. Nothing can understand how humans will perform in stressful situations as well as another human.

John Sanders was a Bonus Baby - a promising rookie that was forced into the big leagues with little preparation long before he was ready. He struggled to acclimate after being pushed into the deep-end and ultimately played only a single game for the Dodgers. His rough experience made him an ideal source of feedback for recruiting programs though. Now, as a scout Sanders looks at all the stats, consults with the computers and mathematicians, but also gets on field and in the players’ homes to talk to family. He says there are things that aren’t quantifiable but are extremely relevant to success in professional sports. Among other things he looks for,

1. **Work ethic** - Playing 6 or 7 times a week requires a significant level of commitment. While other athletes might rest some days during the week, baseball players have to be switched on day after day. Sanders says you can see the discipline in pre-game preparation and post game recovery regimens.
2. **Focus** - Plays happen in seconds. The crucial moments of those plays lasts fractions of seconds. So for a player to be successful they have to register what is happening and react almost instantaneously. Sanders says watching players in practice gives you a sense of their ability to concentrate and focus on tiny details of the game for long periods of time.
3. **Confidence** - Some players are quick to take another position when asked, some are defiant. Both kinds might continue to perform well regardless of changes but Sanders says the latter tends to be better. When players are confident that they’re in control of their skill they perform at higher levels, and are better able to cope with criticism when they hit the inevitable slump.

## Hybrid Approaches

Moneyball changed recruiting but it had its pitfalls. The Oakland Athletics stacked batters but ignored defense. The stats told them to, or rather, there weren’t enough statistics on defense to make recommendations. Soon, their advantage evaporated as bigger and wealthier teams adopted statshead recruiting as a compliment to traditional scouting. Today, most teams operate their recruiting program as a coordinated mix of the two approaches. As nearly always, the best solution lies center of two extremes.
