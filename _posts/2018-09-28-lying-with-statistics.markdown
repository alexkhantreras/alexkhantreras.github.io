# See Through the Fog of Business Statistics and Strike a Better Deal
Darrell Huff's short read on how to detect and avoid BS has been so successful that you've probably read or experienced it in one form or another. Here's why it's been so valuable to corporate decision making at every level: It's a succinct and useful introduction to the statistical traps you'll encounter in deal-making. At some point you'll get the opportunity to make a deal for either yourself or for your company. The decision you make needs to be grounded in a solid understanding of the numbers - sales, costs, forecasts, and trends. Here's a bit on how Huff recommends you proceed.

## Ask, "Says Who?"
The most obvious form of bias you'll encounter in business dealings is conscious and intentionally misleading. Remember that the aim of business always boils down to sales, so you'll eventually have to deal with a salesman. Maybe they're a vendor, a distributor, team members pitching ideas, or customers asking for a new product variations. In any case, you'll need to know what they want. Keep their motivation in mind. This skepticism will be the foundation of your questions, concerns, comments, prods and pokes.

## Ask, "Why Do They Think This?"
It sounds obvious to say that you should look at the reasoning behind a decision but it's often only done at a superficial level. Taking a deep look at the information that is driving the decision is time intensive after all, but as Jeff Bezos says, you're paid to make good decisions not a lot of decisions. Comb the reasoning for signs of implicit and unintentional bias. It's much harder to detect but much more dangerous. 

For example, keep in mind that not all descriptive statistics are not created equal. I can claim an increase in average productivity per employee if I fire half the workforce and the rest pick up the slack or if investment in a new tool actually increased productivity. One is clearly better than the other so get the whole story not just a few summary stats.

When you are quoted some summary stats like maximums, minimums, averages, variances, keep the error in mind. There is always an error rate. Say Johnny scores a 98 and Jenny scores a 101 but the error in the scoring system is +/- 3 points. There are 3 distinct cases in which Johnny actually scored higher than Jenny and 3 in which they scored similarly. A practical rule of thumb that's admittedly easier to remember than to implement is that a small difference is only a difference when it makes a difference.

## Ask, "Is Their Sample Legitimate?"
If the pitch relies on analysis of some sample set, question the legitimacy of the data. Was the sample self-selecting, that is, was the nature of data gathering prone to over sample a certain group? Was the sample large enough to detect trends and to be counted as significant? These are the questions that market research firms must answer daily.

Famous examples of poorly conducted gathering include a Literary Digest pole about the 1936 Presidential Election, which predicted Landon winning handedly. It turns out that Literary Digest' readership was overwhelmingly conservative and so made a poor cross-section of the voting population. So keep in mind that when it's pitched that the Average American is buying, feeling, experiencing, or looking for this or that, that the data collector could not have asked all Americans. Evaluate the data.

## The Semi-Attached Figure
It's easy to hide truth behind terminology and murky mathematical relationships. For example, say I buy some good every morning for $0.99 and sell it every afternoon for $1.00. I can claim that my margins are razor thin - only 1.0% of total sales in profit. I'm using the "same" $0.99 every day though, so my returns on investment are closer to 370%, a figure more representative of reality. 

Other relationships are easier to critique. If some process is claimed to be 15% more efficient your question needs to be, "15% more efficient than what?" A juicer that is 15% more efficient than a hand-cranked juicer might be the least efficient electric juicer on the market but I promise the manufacturer won't mention that on the packaging. 
This bait-and-switch trick is also called the semi-attached figure. It's a number related to the situation but primarily used as a distraction or to help you arrive at an erroneous conclusion. It's analogous to before and after renovation photos wherein the after-photo also includes new furniture and better lighting. It distracts you from the fact that the foundation is still rotten.

## Ask, "Do I Need To Know More?"
There is no replacing a rigorous education and experience in the board room but Huff's short book is a great primer for a lot of common traps that many people walk into on a daily basis. If you're looking to improve your arsenal then this is a good foundation on which to build a better understanding of business statistics.
